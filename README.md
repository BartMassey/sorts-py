# Sorts In Python
Copyright Â© 2018 Bart Massey

This code is a demo of sorting using standard algorithms in
Python. It currently contains Quicksort and Heapsort code.
Quicksort supports both median-of-three (default) and
middle-value partitioning.

The program will run benchmarks and produce log files
suitable for Gnuplot input. Run "sh plotbench.sh" to get
a pretty graph in a window and to "plotbench.png"
